## Background

Maven Cafe is a cafe that is testing new promotional offers for its rewards program. This project seeks to analyze trends following the implementation of these offers to uncover critical insights that will improve Maven's commercial success.

We will be exploring how the various offer types were used by different segments of customers based on age, income level, and visit frequency. In particular, we will be seeing how these segments differ in:

* Revenue generation
* Offer completion rates


We will also be analyzing the effectiveness of sending promotions through various media:

* Website
* Email
* Text message
* Social media
